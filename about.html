		 <h3 style="color:black;;font-size:25px;font-family:Sans-serif"> When we built and designed this zimmer and its surroundings, <br>we had in front of our eyes the high mountain area in  <b>Sinai</b> - a combination of green orchards in wadis,<br> surrounded by stone terraces in the middle of an arid desert,<br> so also a Bustan on the Wadi is an island of green in the middle of the desert.
            <p> We built the zimmer and its surroundings with great love with our own hands,<br> Micah built all the terraces of the stone outside and planted and<br> blossomed in the middle of the desert the orchard and the gardenand <br> Tzruya built almost all the wooden furniture in the zimmer<br> including the kitchen, beds, the outdoor sitting area and more.
             <br>We love the area where we live and would be very happy to host you in our magical corner! <br>
             <br> Micah and Tzruya Erez <br>Merhav Am</h3></p>
